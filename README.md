# Arduino_Handwash_Sensor
This hardware/software project ensures you wash your hands for 20 seconds.

This project was inspired by: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/the-tech-lab/fight-coronavirus-simple-handwash-timer-4dc8ac?ref=tag&ref_id=beginner&offset=0

I used the above idea and added an active buzzer and 1 digit 7 segement LED for countdown. I then took the project a step further by creating an Arduino shield by soldering the components to prototyping board.
